🚀 About Me
I'm a results-driven Data Analyst/Data Scientist with hands-on experience in transforming complex data into actionable insights. With a strong background in SQL, Python, AWS, and data visualization, I help businesses make informed decisions through intuitive dashboards and automation.

My work spans across industries including finance, media, gaming, food services, and facilities management. From building ETL pipelines and processing log data from S3/ELK to developing machine learning models and dashboards in Power BI and Plotly Dash — I love solving problems with data and building tools that drive efficiency and impact.
